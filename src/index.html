          <h1 class="content_item_title cyan">My First Few Programming Projects</h1>

          <p class="cyan">&emsp;I started truly programming in 2019. I had already learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and wanted to start developing my own projects. I created a simple 2d game where the player moves a dot character from the left to the right side of the screen using the arrow keys. I called it '<a class="dot_game_link">Dot Game</a>' and published it as a Google Chrome extension. You can play the game by pressing the '<a class="dot_game_link">Dot Game</a>' button below the text (unfortunately the game can only be played using a keyboard).</p>

            </button>
          </div>

          <p class="cyan">&emsp;Soon after, I developed another game, this time called '<a class="aliens_link">Aliens</a>' and again published it to the Google Chrome extension store. But, it can only be accessed through this website now. By clicking the buttons below, you can access '<a class="aliens_link">Aliens</a>' and view the code on GitHub. Though I gained more experience since the last game, I still had a lot to learn about programming and developing games.</p>

          </div>
          
          <p class="cyan">&emsp;Finally, using what I learned from the last two games, I made '<a class="space_link">Space</a>', an obstacle-avoiding space fighter game. Of my 2019 games, this one was the largest and most polished. But, I was still very inexperienced in game development and programming. As the game grew, it got tougher and tougher to add new features and new levels to the game. The way I structured the game made it hard to use and maintain. Though I had grand ambitions for the game, I was only able to make 18 levels (the last of which is impossible to beat).</p>

            </button>
          </div>

          <p class="cyan">&emsp;I learned a lot about Javascript and general programming through these projects. Each game was an improvement on the last and required me to learn more. But looking back, I would have done a lot of things differently if I were designing these games today.</p>

          <h1 class="content_item_title purple">Developing My Game Framework</h1>

          <p class="purple">&emsp;While making more and more games on my own, I found that I was repeating the same code over and over again. Since my games were made from scratch, I thought, 'Why not make my own game framework with the structure and features I want?' So, I began working on a library of functions and methods I commonly use to create games.</p>

          <p class="purple">&emsp;I used this game framework as a way to try out new technologies and techniques. For example, I tried adding Typescript to the project, and now I almost always use it when developing large Javascript projects (Typescript is a programming language that adds static typing to Javascript). I also experimented with more advanced programming techniques, like higher-order functions, and revamped my framework countless times, changing structure and systems. It grew to become a thousand-line game framework/engine with countless features and systems. Eventually, I decided to give the framework the name '<a class="neutron_link">Neutron</a>'. Below, you can see the framework on GitHub.</p>

          <p class="pink">&emsp;Below are some of the games I made using the framework. Most of them are unfinished. They were made more to test the abilities of the framework, like the physics engine or level loading. '<a class="flappy_bird_link">Flappy Bird</a>' is a copy of the mobile '<a class="flappy_bird_link">Flappy Bird</a>' game. I made it to see how easily I could use my framework to develop a simple game. '<a class="jump_game_link">Jump Game</a>' and '<a class="platformer_link">Platformer</a>' both test out the physics engine and loading levels (I tried out loading levels with images, though I decided there were better ways to load levels). '<a class="explore_link">Explore</a>' was a 2d tile-based test game I also made in my framework.</p>

          <p class="pink">&emsp;In '<a class="flappy_bird_link">Flappy Bird</a>', you control the bird by pressing the spacebar. For '<a class="jump_game_link">Jump Game</a>', you press and release the 'a' and 'd' keys. '<a class="platformer_link">Platformer</a>' requires the use of 'w', 'a', 's', and 'd' keys, along with the space bar. In '<a class="explore_link">Explore</a>', you navigate using either the 'w', 'a', 's', and 'd' keys or the arrow keys.</p>

          <p class="orange">&emsp;For my IB Computer Science SL IA, I created '<a class="self_care_link">Self-Care</a>' an app created to help my mom with self-care activities, like meditation, taking vitamins, taking supplements, and doing hygienic tasks. My mom helped in designing the app so that it included the features she wanted and was organized in a simple easy-to-use way. Depending on what the user inputs, the app makes a schedule for the user and reminds them to complete these self-care items. The app also has recommendations that the user can easily add to their schedule.</p>

To simplify his problem, I made an app to keep track of these fees. I called it '<a class="fees_app_link">Fees App</a>'. It calculates expected expenses over time periods and expected net profit. It also helps you figure out what expenses to remove to have a positive net profit.</p>
